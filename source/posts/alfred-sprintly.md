Since the first [Alfred 2 beta][a2] was released, I've been building a workflow for [Sprintly][sl], the agile task management web app we use at [Terracoding][tc]. The basic features are done so here it is for any other [Mega Supporters][ms] who use Sprintly.

[Download Sprintly for Alfred][dl]

Using the **sly** command, you can switch products, list, add and manage items. Full documentation is [on Github][gh].

**NOTE: The workflow requires a system Ruby â‰¥ 1.9. If you haven't upgraded to Mavericks yet [version 1.0.1][1.0.1] will work with [RVM][].**

To install, run _sly setup {email} {api_key}_.

Feel free to make a pull request [on Github][gh] or let me know what features you would like to see on Twitter: [@samrayner][tw].

Hopefully in the future there'll be an update mechanism for workflows, but until then keep an eye on [the repo][gh] for changes. I'll keep the download link above up-to-date.
