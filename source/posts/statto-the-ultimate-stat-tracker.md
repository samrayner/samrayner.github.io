I don't really blog about Ultimate Frisbee but when I'm not looking at a screen it's what I'll be out doing or at least thinking about.

For the past two years I've had the privilege of representing Great Britain, competing in the Mixed division at the European and World Championships. I also coach and captain the local club team, [Sheffield Steal][steal] and help coach Sheffield's university teams.

Ultimate is growing rapidly in popularity and recognition as a sport. With that growth has come an increasing desire for advanced statistical analysis to gain a better insight into player performance and team strategies.

It will be many years before Ultimate has the funding for the kind of GPS player tracking of more mainstream sports. In the meantime, I've developed an app for the iPhone and iPad to allow coaches, broadcasters and fans to track and analyse Ultimate stats. It's called [Statto][statto] and is [available on the App Store][as].
