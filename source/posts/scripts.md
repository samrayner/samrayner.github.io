I have a bunch of Applescripts and shell scripts that live in [Alfred][a] and make my computing life a little easier. Here's a collection of the the ones I've written. Most of them are pretty niche but hopefully they'll prove useful to somebody.

Toggle Invisible Files
----------------------
If invisibile files are hidden, show them, and vice versa. (Note: will restart Finder).

- [Shell Script](https://gist.github.com/3497115)
- [Alfred Workflow](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/ly7jfu6jg338kgq/Toggle%20Invisible%20Files.alfredworkflow)

Top Google URL
--------------
Grab the URL of the top result for a search (using the [Google Search API][gsapi]) and copy it to the clipboard.

- [Shell Script](https://gist.github.com/3497098)
- [Alfred Workflow](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/ybwc95jctc9tobn/Top%20Google%20URL.alfredworkflow)

Open Tab in Chrome
------------------
Opens the frontmost Safari tab in Google Chrome.

- [Applescript](https://gist.github.com/3497157)
- [Alfred Workflow](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/nvxrrcsahwczui3/Open%20Safari%20Tab%20in%20Chrome.alfredworkflow)

Obfuscator
----------
Takes a chunk of text and converts everything to HTML character entities. Useful for encoding email addresses for spam-free publication on the web. The result is copied to your clipboard.

App Installer
-------------
Move any _.app_ files from _~/Downloads_ to _/Applications_, overwriting existing apps.

5by5 Show Notes
