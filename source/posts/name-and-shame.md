A couple of days ago my first iOS app went up on the App Store! [Name & Shame][as] is an iPhone app for logging and sharing the funny, dumb (or even profound!) things your friends say.

> "David Cameron... didn't he direct Avatar?" -- Erwann Cordon (being quizzed on his general knowledge)

It's free to try out and just 99Â¢ or 69p to upgrade for unlimited quotations. You can import friends from Facebook and Contacts, share quotes on Twitter and Facebook, star your favourites, tag, search and more!

> "...but cats CAN get married!" -- Sarah Harrison

The idea came from sitting with my flatmates discussing possible app ideas that gradually got sillier as we got more desperate. It occurred to me how many times a mate has come out with something funny and I've kicked myself for not having written it down somewhere.

> "There's a town called Crematorium?" -- Joe Crellin (seeing a road sign on the way to Manchester)

The app was developed with help from my mate Sam Millner. Thanks also to [Guy Brown][gb] for his top lectures on iOS and Dom and Rob for their feedback and advice.

Please check it out [on the App Store][as] and take it for a spin! I'd love to know what you think via [email][] or Twitter: [@samrayner][tw].
